A simple project for rapid plugin development.
Simply open git bash, cd into this folder and run ./make.sh

make.sh takes two parameters:
The first is the name of the plugin, this will be the project name, jar file name etc.
The second is the package name and will be used for namespaces and other things that should be lowercase.
